            How It Works ??
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
            Here's how Time Capsule investor works:
          </Typography>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <Typography variant="body1">
                Create a bucket with stocks of your choice.
              </Typography>
            </li>
            <li>
              <Typography variant="body1">
                Set a purchase time period (in years).
              </Typography>
            </li>
            <li>
              <Typography variant="body1">
                Set the investment amount for the bucket. This amount is spread across the bucket stocks uniformly.
              </Typography>
            </li>
            <li>
              <Typography variant="body1">
                The Time Investment Calculator computes how many shares you could have purchased at the given date using historical stock data.
              </Typography>
            </li>
            <li>
              <Typography variant="body1">
                The result shows you the value of your shares at todayâ€™s market price. This is the amount of money you would have made if you purchased this stock on the date you selected.
              </Typography>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <Typography variant="body1" fontWeight="bold">
          **Time Capsule Investor assumes that you can buy stocks in fractional units. 
          <br />
          **Return calculations do not include reinvested cash dividends.
